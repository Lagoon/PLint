h1. Less module

This module allows you to use "LESS":http://lesscss.org/ stylesheets in your Play application, without having to manually compile them to CSS. It is inspired by the sass plugin that does a similar thing for sass.

h2. Usage

Add the less module to your application.conf:

bc. module.less=${play.path}/modules/less

Now any file in your **public/** directory that ends in **.less** is automatically processed by the plugin, and outputted as CSS.

h2. Example

Create a file called **public/stylesheets/style.less**, with contents:

bc. @color: red;
h1 {
  color: @color;
}

Now, add the stylesheet to your main template in **app/views/main.html**:

bc. <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="@{'public/stylesheets/style.less'}" />

h2. Caching

The less module sets and listens to Last-Modified and ETag headers, so most browsers will retrieve the file only once. At the server, a compiled CSS file is stored in the cache, and automatically invalidated when the less file changes, or when one of the imported files change. So you can change your less files even while Play is running in production mode.

h2. Notes

In case of an error in your less file, the error will be shown on your page to help you debug.
