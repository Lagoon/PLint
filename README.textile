In samples-and-tests you can find an example application using Plint named "xcoisas":PLint/tree/master/samples-and-tests/xcoisas ,it simulates an application where users can buy and sell several items.
The URL to enter test application as administrator (access xcoisas administration area) is: 
@http://admin.lvh.me:9000@
@login: admin@
@password: admin@

To enter as a normal user the URL is: @http://xcoisas.lvh.me:9000@, 
here you can register (just store login and password) the application users.

Go to LS so you can change the access configurations of the users from xcoisas to the several resources.
